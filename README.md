Finds three Prime Numbers that add up to an inputted number. 

``` 
git clone https://github.com/Sam-Chee/Goldbachs-Weak-Conjecture.git
cd Goldbachs-Weak-Conjecture/
dotnet run
``` 
There's probably a more efficient way of doing this, as this simply finds as many primes as possible up to the wanted value, then brute forces through each prime until it finds three which adds up to the inputted value.
